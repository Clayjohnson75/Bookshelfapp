# How to Find Your Subscription Product ID

## Step 1: Open Subscriptions in App Store Connect

1. Go to **https://appstoreconnect.apple.com**
2. Click **"My Apps"**
3. Click on your app: **"Bookshelf Scanner"**
4. In the left sidebar, click **"Subscriptions"** (not "In-App Purchases")

## Step 2: Find Your Subscription Group

You should see a subscription group (e.g., "Pro Subscription" or similar).

1. Click on the subscription group
2. You'll see the subscriptions inside that group

## Step 3: Get the Product ID

1. Click on the subscription product (e.g., "Pro Monthly")
2. Look for **"Product ID"** - this is what we need!
3. It should look like: `com.clayjohnson75.bookshelf-scanner.pro.monthly`

**Copy the Product ID exactly as it appears!**

## Step 4: Check Subscription Status

While you're there, also check:
- **Status**: Should be "Ready to Submit" or "Approved"
- **Subscription Duration**: Should be "1 Month" (or whatever you set)
- **Price**: Note the price tier

## What to Tell Me

Once you find it, tell me:

1. **Product ID**: `com.clayjohnson75.bookshelf-scanner.pro.monthly` (or whatever you see)
2. **Status**: "Ready to Submit" or "Approved" or "Waiting for Review"
3. **Price**: What price tier is it set to?

Then I can connect everything! 🚀
